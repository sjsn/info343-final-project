#### Guessing game
Guessing Game is a fill in the blank style game. The user is given a character image and a hint, and based off that hint they guess which character it is. The more guesses it takes, the less points you get.
#### Character Scramble
Character Scramble shuffles the letters in a characters name and, with help from a character image, the user unscrambles the letters. This game gives less points the more guesses it takes.

### Leaderboards
Playing games and collecting cards is fun, but how do users compare to one another? With leaderboards, users can see which users have the most points and the most cards. They can search all users by their usernames to find specific people or can sort by points and number of cards.
