## About Marvel Cards
### Accounts
Create an account to keep track of your points and your cards. Choose a custom username and thumbnail that other players can find you with. You can also take a picture as your favorite character, then save that picture to use as your avatar.

### Games
Play games to earn points and climb the leaderboard. If you win, you can unlock cards which give information about the marvel characters.
#### Guessing game
Guessing Game is a fill in the blank style game. The user is given a character image and a hint, and based off that hint they guess which character it is. The more guesses it takes, the less points you get.
#### Character Scramble
Character Scramble shuffles the letters in a characters name and, with help from a character image, the user unscrambles the letters. This game gives less points the more guesses it takes.

### Leaderboards
Playing games and collecting cards is fun, but how do users compare to one another? With leaderboards, users can see which users have the most points and the most cards. They can search all users by their usernames to find specific people or can sort by points and number of cards.

### Cards
Cards are a way for users to spend their hard earned points. Each card contains information about the characer displayed on it.

## The Project
Built on AngularJS with help from LoDash, Bootstrap, and Firebase. Marvel information comes from the Marvel API.
